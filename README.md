# module2_portfolio

## Description

This project was created using only HTML and CSS and shows a collection of my work, with the languages used for each and contact methods.

The webpage is a portfolio of my work and the page adjusts depending on the screensize.

Smaller screen size: The name is centralised and the nav bar is moved underneath the heading.  It is also aligned vertically

Medium screen size: The name is centralised and the nav bar is move underneath the heading but still in a horizontal layout.

Large screen size: The heading sticks to the left and the nav bar to the right.

The nav bar list links to different sections of the page when clicked and also shows an underline when hovering over each item.

The project work images also change opacity when hovering with the cursor and grow in size.  These images link to my different projects.

There are also links on how to contact me, either linking to my github or linkedin page.
